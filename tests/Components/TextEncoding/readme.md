# Text Encoding
Most of the work when identifying text encodings is done by [uchardet](https://github.com/BYVoid/uchardet), in some cases additional guesswork is required.

## Supported encodings

## Not confident
I am not confident about the following encodings:
- **euc-jp** (example file looks kind of weird)
- **ISO-8859-5** (only example is a ".nfo" file)
- **windows-1258** (example file has no special characters)
- **HZ** (one weird example file)
- **UTF-32** (one weird example file)
- **ISO-8859-11** (wrong example file)
